	<h1>About SQID</h1>
	<p>SQID is a project of the <a href="https://ddll.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Knowledge_Systems/en">Knowledge Systems Group</a> of <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/">TU Dresden</a>. Developers include Markus Krötzsch, Michael Günther and Markus Damm.</p>
	<p>SQID is programmed in JavaScript with additional server-side code in Java and Python to extract, query, and preprocess data.
	</p>
	<h2>What does SQID mean?</h2>
	<p>The origin of the name is unknown, but it seems to be an abbreviation of something. 
	Current hypotheses include:
	<ul>
		<li>Searching, Querying, and Interacting with Data</li>
		<li>Sweet QIDs</li>
		<li>SPARQL Querying Isn't Difficult</li>
		<li>Surprisingly Quick Information Display</li>
		<li>See Quality In Data</li>
    </ul>
    Another possible theory is that the name is indeed inspired by the high intelligence, amazing social skills,
    and sharp vision that are characteristic for many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopoda">cephalopods</a> and Wikidata editors alike.
